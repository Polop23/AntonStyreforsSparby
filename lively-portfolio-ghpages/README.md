# Lively Portfolio — GitHub Pages

A bright, artwork‑forward portfolio landing page with three portals:
**Work Hard**, **Play Hard**, **Think Big**. Built as a static site for
GitHub Pages (no build step required).

## Quickstart
1. Create a new GitHub repository and push this project.
2. Go to **Settings → Pages** and set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
3. The provided workflow will publish the site automatically on push to `main`.

## Local preview
Open `index.html` in your browser (or use a simple static server).

## Customize
- Update copy and links in `index.html` and files under `/pages`.
- Adjust colors and motion in `assets/css/styles.css`.
- Replace contact info in `pages/contact.html`.
